# HITL-and-Human-Feedback
Here are the differences i discovered while trying to wrap my head around (Human in the loop) and (Human feedback).

Question Answered: Is human in the loop and human feedback the same thing?

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) and Human feedback are not the same thing, although they are deeply related and often used together in AI development.

* **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** is a broader **framework or methodolgy** where humans are part of the AI process
- training
- monitoring
- or acting on results

* **Human Feedback** is the specific
- input
- evaluation
- or signal
that the human provides **while in that loop**.

Think of it this way: **HITL is the structure, and human feedback in the content** that flows through that structure. 

# Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) - The "Where" and "When"

HITL refers to designing AI systems that are not fully autonomous. It embeds human expertise at key points in the AI lifesysle, such as data labeling, model training, or decision-making
