# HITL-and-Human-Feedback
Here are the differences i discovered while trying to wrap my head around (Human in the loop) and (Human feedback).

Question Answered: Is human in the loop and human feedback the same thing?

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) and Human feedback are not the same thing, although they are deeply related and often used together in AI development.

* **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** is a broader **framework or methodolgy** where humans are part of the AI process
- training
- monitoring
- or acting on results

* **Human Feedback** is the specific
- input
- evaluation
- or signal
that the human provides **while in that loop**.

Think of it this way: **HITL is the structure, and human feedback in the content** that flows through that structure. 

# Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) - The "Where" and "When"

HITL embeds human expertise at key points in the AI lifesysle, such as data labeling, model training, or decision-making, ensuring that humans can review or correct AI outcomes.

* **Key Aspect:** It defines that workflow.
* **Common Applications:** Data annotation, active learning (asking humans for input on difficult cases), and human approval for AI-driven decisions.
* **Goal:** To improve model accuracy and ensure safety

# Human Feedback - The "What"

Human feedback is the specific data generated by humans in response to an AI's behavior or output. This feedback is used to update the model to be more accurate, helpful, or safe.

* Key Aspect: It is the data or signal
* Forms of Feedback: Thumbsup/down, ranking responses (1st,2nd,3rd), correcting an answer, or labeling an image.
* Goal: To train, refine, or align the model.
